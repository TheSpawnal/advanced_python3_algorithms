Modify the algorithm so that it first checks the input array
to see whether it is already sorted, taking Theta(n) time for an 
n-element array. 
If the array is already sorted, then the algorithm is done, Otherwise,
sort the array as usual. The best-case running time is generally not 
a good measure of an algorithm's efficiency.
